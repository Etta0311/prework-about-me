      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>A graduated aviation student from UNSW, currently learning to be a web developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Hong Kong, an amazing place to visit. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Love listening to music, kpop became one of my favourite in these few years.
        Learning different languages are fun to me too and become multilingual helps a lot on meeting new friends and for travel use.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Pilot! Working above the sky is always my dream since I was a kid.
        Covid stopped me from joining aviation industry but allows me to explore more about my another interested field.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Moved to Sydney for my university studies about 4 year ago and now feels like sydney could be my 2nd home in future.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Back into the days I studied in Hong Kong, my Engineering Diploma provided me a basic knowledge on coding and programming.
        I found that it is fun but also complicated to master the skills, so I used to give up on entering engineering field.
        After covid lockdown, life changed a lot and internet became very important nowadays in this situation.
        People went online for varieties of reasons, for types of online shopping, for entertainments like youtube and video games. With no doubt, majorities of people surf the net at least once on a daily basis.
        This alerts me on how the internet is going to dominate our life in future and motivates me to chanllenge myself on coding.
        With more understanding about coding & programming, I consider it as a language for humans to get connection with computers just like those languages I used to study.
        To master the communication method between me and computers, a position like web developer is the one I wanted to be.
